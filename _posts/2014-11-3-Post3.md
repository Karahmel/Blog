title: How Will I Convey Data? (partially baked ideas)

{{ page.title }}
================
<br />
1) Using color to show increase in choices/instances, <a href="http://i.imgur.com/EV24xuD.jpg">like so.</a></li><br />
2) Using melted to crayons to make a graph, potentially about access to education<br />
3) Conveying data through the taste sense (spiciness, acidity, saltiness, alcohol level)<br />
4) Conveying data through opacity of images or color saturation in real life (like drops of food coloring)<br />
5) Symbolic representations by state or country (age of people in India)<br />
6) Race car track idea (this one needs much more baking)<br />
