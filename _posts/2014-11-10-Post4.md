title: Brainstorming for Our Baltimore Map Project
---

{{ page.title }}
================

Amal and I met last night to discuss what we want to include in our map project. <br />
The map will be a tool for those moving to Baltimore for the first time and will<br />
help them choose an area to focus on for their housing search. We are going to  <br />
focus on 3 things that we think are the key decision-making factors, safety, promixity  <br />
 to cool stuff (including restaurants, grocery stores, transportation), and affordability. <br /> <br />

In order to get information about each of these, we are looking for data sources  <br />
that are credible, current, and easy to mine from. Front runners for the moment:<br /> <br />

<li><span>CRIME</span>&raquo; <a href="http://www.citypaper.com/news/murderink/">MurderInk from the City Paper</a></li>
  
<li><span>PROXIMITY TO STUFF</span> &raquo; <a href="http://www.yelp.com/baltimore">Yelp</a></li>
  
  <li><span>AFFORDABILITY</span>&raquo; <a href="https://baltimore.craigslist.org/search/apa">Craigslist</a></li>

We envision the final being maps you can layer on top of one another to see a combination <br />
of the 3 factors for each area. Then, when overlayed with a standard Bmore map, it pops. <br />
