title: Brainstorming for Our Baltimore Map Project
---

{{ page.title }}
================

Amal and I met last night to discuss what we want to include in our map project. <br />
The map will be a tool for those moving to Baltimore for the first time and will<br />
help them choose an area to focus on for their housing search. We are going to focus <br />
on 3 things that we think are the key decision-making factors, safety, promixity to  <br />
cool stuff (including restaurants, grocery stores, transportation), and affordability. <br /> <br />

In order to get information about each of these, we are looking for data sources  <br />
that are credible, current, and easy to mine from. <br /> <br />
