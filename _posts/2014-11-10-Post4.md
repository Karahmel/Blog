title: Brainstorming for Our Baltimore Map Project
---

{{ page.title }}
================

Amal and I met last night to discuss what we want to include in our map project. <br />
The map will be a tool for those moving to Baltimore for the first time and will help them choose an area to focus on <br />
for their housing search. We are going to focus on 3 things that we think are the key decision-making factors, safety, 
promixity to cool stuff (including restaurants, grocery stores, transportation), and affordability.

In order to get information about each of these, we are looking for data sources that are credible, current, and easy to mine from.
