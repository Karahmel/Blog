{{ page.title }}
================

1) Why won't my images show up on the post pages?
2) What is the point of the default and post layouts? When is each used?
3) How do I make this text on posts a different color/size/more spread out?
4) Can I make a two or three column setup for psots?
5) If I want a picture to show up on the same spot on every page, should I add it to default or footer?

And here is a picture, just for fun.
