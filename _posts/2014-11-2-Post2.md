{{ page.title }}
================
<br />
1) Why won't my images show up on the post pages?<br />
2) What is the point of the default and post layouts? When is each used?<br />
3) How do I make this text on posts a different color/size/more spread out?<br />
4) Can I make a two or three column setup for psots?<br />
5) If I want a picture to show up on the same spot on every page, should I add it to default or footer?<br />
<br />


And here is a picture, just for fun.<br /><br /><br />
